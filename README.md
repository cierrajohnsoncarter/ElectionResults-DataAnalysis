# ElectionResults-DataAnalysis

In this project, I used Numpy to analyze the results of a voting survey and compared sample size accuracy.

A random distribution was created with different sample sizes to demonstrate that a larger sample size will result in more accurate predictions and less chance of failure.

Matplotlib was used to visualize the data.
